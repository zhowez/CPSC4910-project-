# Introduction 
The goal of this project was to make a rewards webapp for truck drivers. Drivers could make an account and apply to their driving company. They could then access the rewards catalog and see thier points history.Companies that wanted to particate with the program could accept/reject new drivers, manage their drivers, and edit the catalog to choose rewards they wanted to give. The only parameters for the project was that it needed to be a web app running on AWS. The group decided everything else
